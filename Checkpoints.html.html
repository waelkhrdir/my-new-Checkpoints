    <p>Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product 
        design at a detailed level, but
         was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[12] 
         From the beginning, Musk consistently maintained that 
         Tesla's long-term goal was to create affordable mass market electric 
         vehicles.[13] The company’s strategy was to
          start with a 
        premium sports car aimed at early 
        adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, 
        including sedans and affordable compacts</p>

               not only all-electric vehicles but also
                infinitely scalable clean energy
                generation and storage products.
                 Tesla believes the faster the world stops
                  relying on fossil 
                fuels and moves towards a zero-emission
